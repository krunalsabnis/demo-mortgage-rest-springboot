## Assignment Requirement

### Application
We would like you to create a java-based backend application using REST.
It should contain the following endpoints.
- **GET** `/api/interest-rates` (get a list of current interest rates)
- **POST** `/api/mortgage-check` (post the parameters to calculate for a mortgage check)

The list of current mortgage rates should be created in memory on application startup.
The mortgage rate object contains the fields:
- `maturityPeriod` (integer)
- `interestRate` (Percentage)
- `lastUpdate` (Timestamp)

The posted data for the mortgage check contains at least the fields:
- `income` (Amount)
- `maturityPeriod` (integer)
- `loanValue` (Amount)
- `homeValue` (Amount)

The mortgage check returns whether the mortgage is feasible (`boolean`) and the monthly cost (`Amount`) of the mortgage.

### Business Rules
- A mortgage should not exceed **4 times** the income.
- A mortgage should not exceed **the home value**.

### Implementation
Treat this application as a real MVP that should go to production.

### Duration
This assignment should take **4-5 hours at the most**.
